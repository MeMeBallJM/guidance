So, we have a google form for students and an approval method for teachers/secretary

Students will have the following options: 
    - which staff member they want to speak to
    - ASK: reason for appointment 
        - the secretary can either approve this or not, but if not approved an email with reasoning 
          will be sent back to the student.  
    - time they need

    

We're going to use APPS Script, basically google js 
-use BABEL to write js and transpile it into google apps script (cos it literally is missing so many features)
-push js to apps script project with CLASP 

use Apps Script API to allow clasp tool to interact with project  code

- store student data in the following: 
  google sheet requestForm
    - name: (String)
    - studNum: (int)
    - time: (int) ie 11.5, or 1.25
    - date: (String or int) ie. 11.5 (november 5th) or just November 5th (idk which is easier in this inplementation)
    
HOLY CRAP, CLASP IS SO COOL, IVE NEVER USED IT BUT ITS SO COOL HOW IT WORKS WOAHHHH
